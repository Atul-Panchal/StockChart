              Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy on
              relevant historical data to ensure its viability before the trader
              risks any actual capital. A trader can simulate the trading of a
              strategy over an appropriate period of time and analyze the
              results for the levels of profitability and risk. Streak AI

              your strategies to not function as you had intended or fail to

              strategic trading is rapidly changing as a practice and as an
              industry. Models of markets used to write and test trading
              strategies are inherently limited and often fail to perform as
              expected. In addition, trading strategies are implemented in
              software programming code, and no matter how well designed and
              thoroughly tested, any such code can have logical errors and bugs
              that cause the strategies to malfunction or suggest trades that,
              if executed, would result in losses. It is your obligation to
              thoroughly and appropriately test any trading strategic before you
              deploy it and to continually monitor the operation of any deployed
              trading strategic to ensure it is running properly and in

              In addition to all of the risks described above, live strategic

            <span>
              It is not possible for a computer model to truly predict what
              might have happened if a strategic-based trading strategy was in
              play in a live trading environment. For example, the
              implementation of such a strategy can itself have an impact on the
              market, and the model may fail to account for real-life factors
              that impact the model. Moreover, the model may fail to account for
              execution costs including broker commissions, fees, and trading
              slippage.

            <span>
              A promising model result does not necessarily predict a successful
              strategy. Execution of the strategy and the performance of that
              code may prove to be impossible in a live trading environment.
              Changes in various market factors not foreseen in a model can
              change, causing a strategy to fail. A backtest might be
              over-fitted to past data, and fail when the strategy is applied to
              new, live data. Orders that were executed correctly in the
              backtesting environment may be disallowed or rejected because of
              various reasons eg: margin requirement , illiquid stocks etc
              causing the strategy to fail or otherwise not perform as expected.
              Attempts to create, exit, or cancel orders might fail, or might
              result in unexpected outcomes. Moreover, your strategy might not
              handle market conditions that cannot be reasonably anticipated,
              i.e., a “flash crash” or an exchange outage. These market
              conditions, by definition, will not have been tested.

              terminated. Streak does not verify the margin requirement,

              immediately triggers an SL-M order. This is a STOP LOSS order
              which the user can place or cancel. Canceling this order will NOT
              terminate the strategy and your positions will be open and if your
              Stop Loss is triggered later , then a notification is sent again
              to the user. (If you have already placed the SL-M order then if

              18. If the user's order is rejected due to various reasons such as
              shortage of funds, circuit limit hit, no liquidity in market, etc,
              the strategy will be stopped and no further alerts will be sent
              for that strategy. This is done in order to avoid unnecessary
              tracking of instruments where the order placement failed. However,
              the user can deploy the strategy again and take action on any new
              alerts that get generated.
