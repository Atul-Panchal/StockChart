            You are Solely Responsible for Input, Correctness, and Accuracy. The
            quality of the product's analysis and optimization depends on the
            user's inputs. After deployment, alerts have been made available in
            the product to ease and expedite your entry of the position, and
            you, as user of the system, are solely responsible for ensuring the
            quality of all its inputs. As such, you must carefully review all
            input parameters in all ways necessary to ensure their accuracy and
            fidelity. While there are other factors governing analysis and
            optimization accuracy, the quality of the product outputs depends on
            the accuracy of your inputs. The trades generated by the Service may
            increase beyond what is practical to execute, due to broker
            execution limits and the difficulties in executing a complex trade
            in an all-or-none fashion. Moreover, once the trade is executed, the
            management of a complex trade becomes more difficult than is
            normally the case. Another factor is that you may not be authorized
            to execute all contract types found in the solutions generated.
            Chattel Technologies Ltd. makes no representation that a solution
            generated by the Service can be executed and effectively monitored
            and managed in practice. It is entirely your responsibility to
            assess the appropriateness, suitability, and practicality of the
            solutions generated by the optimizer. It is your responsibility to
            ensure the trade is executable and manageable, and appropriate for
            your needs.

          <span>7. Backtesting and data.</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>
            Backtesting results are hypothetical and are simulated on historical
            data. The performance results have certain inherent limitations.
            Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these
            results do not represent actual trading. These trades have not
            actually been executed, these results may have under-or
            over-compensated for the impact especially when we have lack of
            liquidity in the market or news driven events or any other
            conditions. Simulated or hypothetical trading strategies in general
            are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit
            of hindsight. &nbsp;
          </span>
          <span>
            No representation is being made that any account will or is likely
            to achieve profits or losses similar to those backtested.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span>
            In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk,
            and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the
            impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability
            to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading Strategies
            in spite of trading losses are material points which can also
            adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other
            factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation
            of any specific Strategies trading which cannot be fully accounted
            for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all
            of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

            one or more of the objectives of your strategies. strategic trading
            is rapidly changing as a practice and as an industry. Models of
            markets used to write and test trading strategies are inherently
            limited and often fail to perform as expected. In addition, trading
            strategies are implemented in software programming code, and no
            matter how well designed and thoroughly tested, any such code can
            have logical errors and bugs that cause the strategies to
            malfunction or suggest trades that, if executed, would result in
            losses. It is your obligation to thoroughly and appropriately test

          <span>Certain Risks of Live Strategic Trading</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>
            In addition to all of the risks described above, live strategic
            trading is subject to the following types of types of risk:
          </span>
        </p>
        <h3>
          <span>i. Backtesting Cannot Assure Actual Results.</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <span>
            It is not possible for a computer model to truly predict what might
            have happened if a strategic-based trading strategy was in play in a
            live trading environment. For example, the implementation of such a
            strategy can itself have an impact on the market, and the model may
            fail to account for real-life factors that impact the model.
            Moreover, the model may fail to account for execution costs
            including broker commissions, fees, and trading slippage.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            A promising model result does not necessarily predict a successful
            strategy. Execution of the strategy and the performance of that code
            may prove to be impossible in a live trading environment. Changes in
            various market factors not foreseen in a model can change, causing a
            strategy to fail. A backtest might be over-fitted to past data, and
            fail when the strategy is applied to new, live data. Orders that
            were executed correctly in the backtesting environment may be
            disallowed or rejected because of various reasons eg: margin
            requirement , illiquid stocks etc causing the strategy to fail or
            otherwise not perform as expected. Attempts to create, exit, or
            cancel orders might fail, or might result in unexpected outcomes.
            Moreover, your strategy might not handle market conditions that
            cannot be reasonably anticipated, i.e., a “flash crash” or an
            exchange outage. These market conditions, by definition, will not
            have been tested.

            relating to infrastructure, connectivity, and similar factors.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Your strategy might suffer from adverse market conditions. Those
            conditions can include lack of liquidity, and abrupt and unwarranted
            price swings. Also possible are late market openings, early market
            closings, market chaos, and mid-day trading pauses, and other such
            disruptive events.

            may get rejected in error or by design, incorrectly execute orders,
            or induce errors through unexpected behavior (such as returning
            messages out of sequence, incorrectly acknowledging orders, or
            posting incorrect execution reports). If at all, any losses arise

            not placed in ways that are not desired. You may receive incorrect
            information, or be unable to get information, about your orders,
            your positions, or market conditions. Incorrect actions may be

        </h3>
        <p>
          <span>
            Strategic trading depends on the availability of various services
            from third parties in addition to your service provider and your
            broker. These, for example, include providers of data services,
            computational services, and network connectivity. The operations of
            these third parties are beyond all of our reasonable control.
            Regardless of the reason for any failure by your broker, the market

            Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the
            success of strategic trading. The systems of these data providers
            could experience failures, errors, and latency, which could result
            in missing, incorrect, or stale market data.

          <span>
            Once the strategy is live and an alert is generated based on the
            conditions in the strategy, our systems attempt to deliver the alert
            to the user over the internet. By using this service, the user
            acknowledges they understand that the alerts' delivery is dependent
            on many factors such as the internet connection of the user,
            location, time of the day, server load, data availability etc.

            We recommend users to be logged in to LePaisa.in, keep it open in
            their browser and maintain a fast uninterrupted internet connection
            to their devices to see the best alerts delivery.

          <span>Lepaisa relies on &nbsp;</span>
          <span>
            third party services for market data eg. for ticks, OHLCV etc.
          </span>
          <span>
            &nbsp; If these services are down due to unforeseen circumstances or
            experience a down time due to various technical / non technical
            issues, Streak might not be able to generate and deliver the
            actionable alerts on time or at all. Market prices, data and other
            information available through Streak are not warranted as to
            completeness or accuracy and are subject to change without notice.
            System response and account access times may vary due to a variety
            of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system
            performance, and other factors.

          <span>
            Once a signal is generated, we try to send this signal to the user's
            device over the internet. The delivery of these alerts are subject
            to network conditions of the user, internet services and technical
            issues.

            Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the
            success of strategic trading. Our service providers or systems that
            provide data could experience failures, errors, lag, and latency
            which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market data
            leading to no/wrong signals(alert) while triggering an alert.

        <p>
          <span>
            All actionable order alerts are read-only market order alerts, where
            with a single click the user can send the order to the exchange. The
            actionable order alerts are made read-only in order to obtain
            consistency in the deployed and backtest results and to avoid any
            drastic increase in risk. If on any scrip / instruments such as
            Stock, Futures, Currency Futures etc., there is high volatility due
            to news based or non news based or any speculative events /
            positions, Streak is not responsible for higher slippages. You
            understand that volatility is the nature of the market.

          <span>
            Upon clicking on buy/sell on the order window, based on users
            network speed, a network latency can be experienced and any rapid
            clicks on the buy/sell button through same or different windows can
            lead to multiple order placements. Users take full responsibility
            for making sure the actions on the notifications are their own
            actions and are fully aware of their positions and strategy status
            when clicking on the buy/sell button.

          <span>The strategy cycle</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp; Entry and respective exit of a strategy is defined as a
            strategy cycle.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Once a strategy is deployed, the stocks are periodically tracked
            based on the conditions in the strategy. The periodicity with which
            the market is tracked is the same as the candle interval selected by
            the user while backtesting the strategy and shown in the strategy
            summary before deployment. An strategy's ideal life cycle and the
            tree of events that can occur during an strategy's life cycle,
            called an "strategy cycle", has been explained below:
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            1. Waits for the first entry event as per the entry condition in the
            deployed section.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            2. Once the entry event occurs, an entry signal (buy/sell) is
            triggered and an actionable alert is sent to the user.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            3. The user can choose to act on the alert by clicking buy/sell or
            choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancelling from the
            notification window will terminate the strategy).
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            4. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market order
            is sent to the exchange (NSE).
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            5. The order will either be successfully placed by the exchange or
            it might get rejected due to reasons such as insufficient capital,
            etc. If the order gets rejected by the exchange, the strategy gets
            terminated. Streak does not verify the margin requirement, the
            broker determines the margin requirement as all orders are placed on
            the broker.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            6. After the successful placement of an order, the strategy
            immediately triggers an SL-M order. This is a STOP LOSS order which
            the user can place or cancel. Canceling this order will NOT
            terminate the strategy and your positions will be open and if your
            Stop Loss is triggered later , then a notification is sent again to
            the user. (If you have already placed the SL-M order then if the SL
            hits first then this order will get executed and the position is
            closed).
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            7. The strategy continues to track the stock waiting for the exit
            signal (SL or TP) or exit condition. Based on the entry price and
            the SL and TP percentages entered by the user, the SL and TP prices
            are calculated which are displayed to the user in the Deployed Page
            Subsection ENTERED.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            8. When the SL/TP price occurs or if the exit condition is met,
            whichever occurs first, an actionable notification is sent to the
            user again. The user can then choose to act on it by clicking
            buy/sell or choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancel will
            terminate the strategy). &nbsp;
          </span>
          <span>Note:</span>
          <span>
            &nbsp; If you cancel the SL or TP alert from the notification/alerts
            page the strategy gets terminated. However, if you cancel the
            notification or alert from the order log in the deployed page, the
            strategy is not terminated.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            9. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market order
            is sent to the exchange (NSE) and the strategy's life cycle is now
            complete.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            10. The "strategy cycle" sequence defined above is an ideal sequence
            and is subject to market conditions and user behaviour. Based on the
            user's action or market conditions, the sequence might not
            completely occur in the same way as it is intended to, since this
            sequence may have been interrupted due to various reasons such as,
            the user stopping the strategy, order rejection by the exchange,
            network lag, network error etc.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            11. For both intraday and overnight strategies, the strategy cycle
            has to be defined by the user during deployment. Depending on the
            number of strategy cycles, the strategy moves to a 'complete' state
            and is stopped.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            12. Margins are not blocked till the user acts on the actionable
            alerts (buy/sell) and the order is sent to the exchange.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            13.The strategy can be stopped by the user at any time in the life
            cycle of the strategy by clicking on the "Stop" button. If the
            strategy has not entered a position, it will be directly stopped
            otherwise the user will be presented with an option to either stop
            the strategy by keeping the positions open or to exit positions at
            market and stop the strategy. The strategy will no longer be tracked
            and no further alerts will be sent to the user for the respective
            strategy.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            14. In cases where the user stops the strategy and chooses to keep
            positions open, the responsibility of closing any and all positions
            is solely on the user, and user will get no alerts for that deployed
            instrument once the strategy is stopped. &nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            15. For order type MIS, all strategies will be stopped at 3:20 PM
            (4:30 PM for currency futures, 11:30pm for MCX) and the open
            positions, if any, will be squared off by the respective broker
            (example, Zerodha, Angel One, Upstox(RKSV) or 5paisa) before market
            close and charges for closure by broker is applied
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            16. All actionable order alerts sent to the user can be used only
            once and will be active for only 5 minutes after which the alert
            expires in the notification/ alerts section. However, these alerts
            are actionable in the order log section of the Deployed Page.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            17. All actionable alert orders are market orders and users can
            expect price variation from the price at which the alert was
            triggered to the price at which the order is placed. Slippages are
            expected to occur.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            18. If the user's order is rejected due to various reasons such as
            shortage of funds, circuit limit hit, no liquidity in market, etc,
            the strategy will be stopped and no further alerts will be sent for
            that strategy. This is done in order to avoid unnecessary tracking
            of instruments where the order placement failed. However, the user
            can deploy the strategy again and take action on any new alerts that
            get generated.
