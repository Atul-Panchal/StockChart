              Once the strategy is live and an alert is generated based on the
              conditions in the strategy, our systems attempt to deliver the
              alert to the user over the internet. By using this service, the
              user acknowledges they understand that the alerts' delivery is
              dependent on many factors such as the internet connection of the
              user, location, time of the day, server load, data availability
              etc.

            <span>
              third party services for market data eg. brokers for ticks, OHLCV
              etc.
            </span>
            <span>
              &nbsp; If these services are down due to unforeseen circumstances
              or experience a down time due to various technical / non technical
              issues, Streak might not be able to generate and deliver the
              actionable alerts on time or at all.

          <p>
            <span>
              Once a signal is generated, we try to send this signal to the
              user's device over the internet. The delivery of these alerts are
              subject to network conditions of the user, internet services and
              technical issues.

              Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the
              success of strategic trading. Our service providers or systems
              that provide data could experience failures, errors, lag, and
              latency which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market
              data leading to no/wrong signals(alert) while triggering an alert.

          </p>

          <p>
            <span>
              All actionable order alerts are read-only market order alerts,
              where with a single click the user can send the order to the
              exchange. The actionable order alerts are made read-only in order
              to obtain consistency in the deployed and backtest results and to
              avoid any drastic increase in risk. If on any scrip / instruments
              such as Stock, Futures, Currency Futures etc., there is high
              volatility due to news based or non news based or any speculative
              events / positions, Streak is not responsible for higher
              slippages. You understand that volatility is the nature of the
              market.

              Upon clicking on buy/sell on the order window, based on users
              network speed, a network latency can be experienced and any rapid
              clicks on the buy/sell button through same or different windows
              can lead to multiple order placements. Users take full
              responsibility on making sure the actions on the notifications are
              their own actions and are fully aware of their positions and
              strategy status when clicking on the buy/sell button.

            <span>The strategy cycle</span>
            <span>
              &nbsp; Entry and respective exit of an strategy is defined as an
              strategy cycle.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Once an strategy is deployed, the stocks are periodically tracked
              based on the conditions in the strategy. The periodicity with
              which the market is tracked is the same as the candle interval
              selected by the user while backtesting the strategy and shown in
              the strategy summary before deployment. An strategy's ideal life
              cycle and the tree of events that can occur during an strategy's
              life cycle, called an "strategy cycle", has been explained below:
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              1. Waits for the first entry event as per the entry condition in
              the deployed section.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              2. Once the entry event occurs, a entry signal (buy/sell) is
              triggered and an actionable alert is sent to the user.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              3. The user can choose to act on the alert by clicking buy/sell or
              choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancelling from the
              notification window will terminate the strategy).
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              4. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market
              order is sent to the exchange (NSE).
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              5. The order will either be successfully placed by the exchange or
              it might get rejected due to reasons such as insufficient capital,
              etc. If the order gets rejected by the exchange, the strategy gets
              terminated. Streak does not verify the margin requirement, the
              broker(s) determines the margin requirement as all orders are
              placed on the broker.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              6. After the successful placement of an order, the strategy
              immediately triggers an SL-M order. This is a STOP LOSS order
              which the user can place or cancel. Canceling this order will NOT
              terminate the strategy and your positions will be open and if your
              Stop Loss is triggered later , then a notification is sent again
              to the user. (If you have already placed the SL-M order then if
              the SL hits first then this order will get executed and position
              is closed).
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              7. The strategy continues to track the stock waiting for the exit
              signal (SL or TP) or exit condition. Based on the entry price and
              the SL and TP percentages entered by the user, the SL and TP
              prices are calculated which are displayed to the user in the
              Deployed Page Subsection ENTERED.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              8. When the SL/TP price occurs or if the exit condition is met,
              whichever occurs first, an actionable notification is sent to the
              user again. The user can then chose to act on it by clicking
              buy/sell or choose to ignore the alert and cancel it (cancel will
              terminate the strategy). &nbsp;
            </span>
            <span>Note:</span>
            <span>
              &nbsp; If you cancel the SL or TP alert from the
              notification/alerts page the strategy gets terminated. However, if
              you cancel the notification or alert from the order log in
              deployed page, the strategy is not terminated.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              9. If the user has clicked on buy/sell in the alert, a market
              order is sent to the exchange (NSE) and the strategy's life cycle
              is now complete.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              10. The "strategy cycle" sequence defined above is an ideal
              sequence and is subject to market conditions and user behaviour.
              Based on the user's action or market conditions, the sequence
              might not completely occur in the same way as it is intended to,
              since this sequence may have been interrupted due to various
              reasons such as, the user stopping the strategy, order rejection
              by the exchange, network lag, network error etc.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              11. For both intraday and overnight strategies, the strategy cycle
              has to be defined by the user during deployment. Depending on the
              number of strategy cycles, the strategy moves to a 'complete'
              state and is stopped.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              12. Margins are not blocked till the user acts on the actionable
              alerts (buy/sell) and the order is sent to the exchange.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              13.The strategy can be stopped by the user at any time in the life
              cycle of the strategy by clicking on the "Stop" button. If the
              strategy has not entered a position, it will be directly stopped
              otherwise the user will be presented with an option to either stop
              the strategy by keeping the positions open or to exit positions at
              market and stop the strategy. The strategy will no longer be
              tracked and no further alerts will be sent to the user for the
              respective strategy.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              14. In cases where the user stops the strategy and chooses to keep
              positions open, the responsibility of closing any and all
              positions is solely on the user, and the user will get no alerts
              for that deployed instrument once the strategy is stopped. &nbsp;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              15. For order type MIS, all strategies will be stopped at 3:20 PM
              (4:30 PM for currency futures, 11:30pm for MCX) and the open
              positions, if any, will be squared off by the respective broker
              (example, Zerodha, Angel Broking, 5Paisa) before market close and
              charges for closure by broker is applied
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              16. All actionable order alerts sent to the user can be used only
              once and will be active for only 5 minutes after which the alert
              expires in the notification/ alerts section. However, these alerts
              are actionable in the order log section of the Deployed Page.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              17. All actionable alert orders are market orders and users can
              expect price variation from the price at which the alert was
              triggered to the price at which the the order is placed. Slippages
              are expected to occur.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              18. If the user's order is rejected due to various reasons such as
              shortage of funds, circuit limit hit, no liquidity in market, etc,
              the strategy will be stopped and no further alerts will be sent
              for that strategy. This is done in order to avoid unnecessary
              tracking of instruments where the order placement failed. However,
              the user can deploy the strategy again and take action on any new
              alerts that get generated.

              &nbsp; You can create, backtest and deploy currency futures in
              Streak. Each quantity corresponds to 1 lot size i.e, 1000. MIS
              strategies will be stopped at 4:30 PM and open positions, if any
              will be squared off.
